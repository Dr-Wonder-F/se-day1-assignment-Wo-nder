#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systemati application of enginnering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of a software. 
Solftware enginnering has in a large part significantly improved the life of the entire planet by ensuring that each software used today are reliable and scalable with the ability of meet requirements efficiently. The importance of Software engineering include enhancing software quality, reliability, improve efficiency, facilitating teamwork and project management.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three key milestones in Software Engeering (SWE)
a. Introduction of structured programming (1960s to 1970s) - this era encouraged modular code organization and improved  readability nad maintainability
b. Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s -1990s) - this is two (2) decades have led to the introduction of concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism which enabled the reuse of code and improved scability.
c. The rise of agile methodologies (2000s - present day) - this the new agae which shifted focus to iterative development with the integration of customer collaboration and improve responsisveness to the changing requirements. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of Software Developnment life cycle(SDLC)
List of Phases: Planning and Requirement analysis, design, implementation (coding), testing, ddeployment, maintenance.
a. Planning and Requirement Analysis: This phase encompasses identifying software needs, defining objectives, and evaluating feasibility.

b. Design: This step involves crafting the software architecture and creating design specifications.

c. Implementation (Coding): During this phase, the actual software is developed and coded.

d. Testing: In this stage, we ensure that the software meets quality standards and operates correctly.

e. Deployment: This phase involves releasing the software for end-user access.

g. Maintenance: Following the release, this phase includes performing updates, fixing bugs, and implementing improvements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology employs a sequential development approach, which offers low flexibility and limited customer involvement. This makes it well-suited for large-scale projects with clearly defined requirements, such as government contracts. In contrast, the Agile methodology is iterative and highly flexible, emphasizing continuous collaboration with customers. This makes it ideal for rapid development projects with evolving requirements, such as those found in startups and SaaS applications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Responsible for writing and maintaining code, implementing features, and fixing bugs.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Conducts software testing to ensure reliability and performance.
Project Manager (PM) – Oversees project progress, manages timelines, and facilitates team collaboration.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Tools like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse provide features such as syntax highlighting, debugging, and code suggestions.
Version Control Systems (VCS) – Platforms like Git and GitHub help in tracking changes, collaborating efficiently, and managing different code versions.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a. Managing Complex Codebases
b. Debugging Difficult Issues.
c. Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes 
d. Team Collaboration Difficulties 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components of the software.
Integration Testing: Ensures different modules work together correctly.
System Testing: Validates the functionality of the entire system.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software meets user requirements before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves designing and optimizing input queries to effectively interact with AI models. It ensures that inputs are clear, precise, and structured, leading to desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about chemistry."

Improved Prompt: "Explain how chemistry principles are used in transforming the healthcare industry, including specific examples of AI applications in currently employed to improve these principles."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

Specificity – Narrows down the focus to AI in healthcare.

Clarity – Clearly states the expected response format.

Conciseness – Uses precise wording to convey intent.
